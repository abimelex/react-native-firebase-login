# React Native Firebase Login Example

This little project shows how to use Firebase for an basic E-Mail and password login.
A firebase project is required for this.

# Getting started

- Please set the credentials from you firebase web project in the `/src/config/firebase.js` file.
- E-Mail needs to be enabled as an authentication method in your firebase project.

Set up react native fro your OS as described at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

## Start react native in Terminal

    react-native start

## In another tab:

    react-native run-android
   
# Contributers welcome

Since I'm just getting started with react-native give me a hint or create a pull request if you would something in a different way.
